# Traffic-Violations
As a burgeoning data analyst, I have undertaken a project that required substantial data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization using Python.
This project was challenging due to a significant amount of data anomalies, which sometimes impeded grouping of columns and effective implementation of my logic for data queries. 
The dataset analyzed was a comprehensive record of traffic violations committed between 2005 to 2015. During my analysis, 
I discovered several key findings, including:
The highest incidence of violations, such as speeding and moving violations, occurred in the morning, between 9:30 and 11:00 a.m.
Men were found to commit the highest number of violations, accounting for 62,649 instances, while women were responsible for 23,464 violations.
The most frequent violations committed by both genders were speeding and moving violations.
Although most drivers were issued citations, the highest number of arrests resulted from speeding violations.
Drivers stopped between 16 to 30 minutes were more likely to be arrested, as this time period recorded the highest number of arrests.
Drivers aged 20-23 were found to commit the most violations, with 22-year-olds being the most frequent offenders.
Speeding violations were responsible for the highest number of arrests.
